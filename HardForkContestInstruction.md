# Bluzelle Swarm of Duty 2 - Hard Fork Contest Instruction


Welcome to Bluzelle Swarm of Duty 2 - Hard Fork Contest. This contest is served as a “dress rehearsal” for the hard fork, while making sure the new network is thoroughly tested and run as expected. It will be conducted on a NEW TESTNET that we are launching in parallel with the soft mainnet.

We are providing token incentives for current soft mainnet validators and other public members who would like to help stress test our new network. 500 BLZ — 5000 BLZ will be given out for each task delegated by the team. Existing soft mainnet validators will receive 30% bonus on top of the reward for completed task.

## Category A. Hard Fork Rehearsal (1,500 BLZ)

In this task, you are required to go through our instruction to set up a node of your own on the new testnet. Only 50 participants who fulfill the below criteria will be rewarded for this category:

- The rehearsal will start at block height XXX (to be announced) and last for around 3 weeks. We will announce the ending block height in advance.
- Your validator must be at "ACTIVE" state at the ending block height.
- Your validator must achieve 98% voting participation (as shown on [CENSUS](https://census.testnet.public.bluzelle.com/validators).
- In the case where more than 50 participants achieve 98% voting participation, only those with Top 50 voting participation will be rewarded
- In the case where there is a tie in the contest, or a network halt that impacts the final results, the Bluzelle team reserves the rights to determine the top 50 winners based on other criteria with prior notice.
- All existing soft mainnet nodes that participate in this contest will receive 30% additional reward.

## Category B. White Hat Attack (up to 5,000 BLZ)
Validators will be encouraged to conduct attacks in any aspects against the network and provide all-rounded stress test to the network. Examples can be spamming of network with many malicious transactions, attempts to invalidate transactions by tampering blockchain history, or abusing the economic system to steal tokens or avoid fees. Any reported attack that successfully causes issue on the network (or even halt the blockchain) will be rewarded up to 5,000 BLZ.

## Category C. Bug hunting (Various)
Whenever you discover a bug or initiate a successful attack, it is important to document it and report to our team. Amount of rewards will be evaluated based on the severity of the bug and subjected to the Bluzelle team’s judgement.
