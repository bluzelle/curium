Using the Bluzelle Curium Zone
==============================
# Queries
The querying subcommands provide access to the unsigned functinality of the the Curium cli. These commands do not use gas and results are returned directly.

The CLI can provide usage help for the queries with the following command:

    $ blzcli q --help

# Transactions
Transactional commands can be crytographically signed and require gas to perform. Where a command has a return value users must employ the "tx" query to retrieve the response.

The CLI can provide usage help for the queries with the following command:

    $ blzcli tx --help
