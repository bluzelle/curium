# Network REHEARSAL Instructions from `Bluzelle Soft MainNet` to `Bluzelle Final TestNet`

:warning: Please read carefully before you begin the rehearsal. Also note. It is NOT INTENDED that you replace your existing SOFT MAINNET NODE(s) with Bluzelle Final TestNet node(s). 

The intention here is to run ADDITIONAL node(s) as a REHEARSAL for the Final MainNet launch. Please be sure to keep your existing Soft MainNet node(s) running.

# Validators and optional Sentries

All coordination efforts will be done in the <Yingyao please fill in this link> channel in the Bluzelle Discord Channel.

:warning: Don't delete your `soft mainnet` validator and sentry machine(s). You are rehearsing here for the actual Final MainNet Launch, which is to occur soon.

:warning: If your Final TestNet machines have a previous installation on them, you will need to remove those, before you continue:

You're probably familiar with the process of setting up a Bluzelle node by now:

Please follow the instructions for the REHEARSAL path.
